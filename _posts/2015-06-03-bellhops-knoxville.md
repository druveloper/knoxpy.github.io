Adam Haney, [Bellhops](https://getbellhops.com) CTO and Knoxville native will present general architecture of the system. We can ask anything related to Bellhops or technologies they have used.

Bellhops is a web and mobile platform that connects customers in 130 cities with contractors who help with moving, labor and delivery tasks. They have differentiated from the existing moving industry by providing amazing customer service and technology that allows them to provide moving help at a lower cost and with much more convenience. They do all of this through mobile and web applications are supported by their RESTful API which is written in Python using the Django web framework.

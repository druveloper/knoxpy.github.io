This will be our first Python meeting of 2016. To bring in the new year, we have a new location and time: meetings will be on the first Thursday of each month at the Technology Cooperative in Emory Place located near downtown Knoxville; across the street from the Crafty Bastard Brewery. If you have ideas and suggestions about what KnoxPy should become, then please attend this meeting. We are still looking for sponsors and presenters so leave a comment below if you are interested in doing a presentation or providing a sponsorship.

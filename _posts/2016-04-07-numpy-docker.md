For our April meeting, we'll have a presentation about using NumPy for scientific computing in Python by Gavin Wiggins. You can learn more about NumPy at [numpy.org](http://www.numpy.org). We'll also have an overview on using Docker to distribute applications by Mike Hagedorn. Visit the Docker website at [docker.com](https://www.docker.com) for more information about the platform. And don't forget to attend the meeting to get your free swag from [Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io), the makers of Anaconda.

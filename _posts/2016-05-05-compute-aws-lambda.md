This month Andy Cowell will talk about running Python code on AWS Lambda without the need to provision or manage servers. The code can be triggered from other AWS services or called directly from any web or mobile app. More information on AWS Lambda is available at [https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/](). Don't forget to join KnoxPy on Twitter, GitHub, and Slack via the links on our website at [http://knoxpy.org]().

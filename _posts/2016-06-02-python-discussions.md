Instead of having a presentation this month, we'll focus on answering questions about Python. This is a good opportunity for everyone to learn something from other members in the group. If you don't have Python on your computer, feel free to bring your Mac, Linux, or Windows laptop so we can help you install it on your system. Also, if you have a particular question, consider posting it before the meeting in the comments section of this month's Meetup or in the #python channel on KnoxDevs Slack. See ya in June!

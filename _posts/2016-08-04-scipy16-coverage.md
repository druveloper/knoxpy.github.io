This month we’ll have Jean Bilheux give an overview of what he learned at the SciPy 2016 conference. More info about the conference can be found at [http://scipy2016.scipy.org/](). We will also give away a copy of "Python 101” by Michael Driscoll during the meeting; you must attend the meeting for a chance to win the book. We'll also have a "mystery" speaker make an announcement at the end of the meeting.

In this meeting, [Christopher Ostrouchov](https://twitter.com/costrouc) will introduce [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org) in an interactive way, so make sure to bring your laptops (no installation will be needed). Important concepts such as configuration, setting up remote workers, and managing task dependencies with Celery Canvas will be covered. Chris has found Celery an extremely helpful tool for automating both long and short running tasks in HPC. We hope to excite you with the simplicity of setting up Celery and getting started with automating complex jobs!

This month's speaker is Mark McIntyre from Scripps Networks. At Scripps Networks, AWS is our cloud of choice and even with the tools they provide we still need to make it all work. Python is what we have chosen to build the parts we need to make it work. With the boto3 library, we can access all the AWS services and resources to make automation possible.

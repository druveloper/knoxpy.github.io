This month we'll have a networking event at the Crafty Bastard Brewery. All ages are welcome, you just need to be 21 to drink. A food truck will also be available so plan on grabbing some yummy grub for dinner. The meetup will be co-hosted with the KnoxData group. This is the last meetup of 2017, we'll resume our regular python meeting at the Tech-Cooperative in February 2018.

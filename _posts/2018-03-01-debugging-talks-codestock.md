Rob Scott (@Spamagnet) will give a preview of his CodeStock presentation at this month's KnoxPy meeting. The abstract for his talk is: "Software is expensive, so naturally managers are rarely keen to hear that large chunks need to be rewritten. Why didn't we get it right the first time? We explain why it's not so bad, using the sunk cost fallacy and an extended analogy of software as the blueprint of a city built from nothing by nanobots."

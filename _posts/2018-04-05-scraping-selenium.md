title: Scraping with Selenium
time: 6:30-8:30pm

Web scraping is typically done with the Requests or Beautiful Soup libraries in Python. These tools are great for scraping static web pages but there parsing ability is less effective on dynamic/interactive sites. As an alternative to the above libraries, Gavin Wiggins will demonstrate using Selenium with Python to control a web browser and collect data from interactive web pages. Pandas and NLTK will also be used for analyzing the web data and presenting trends from the content. An example of applying these tools on a conference website will be demonstrated during the presentation.

Dash is a framework developed by Plotly to allow you to create web apps with Python (and the packages of interest) and some custom CSS. It uses Flask, Plotly's own javascript library Plotly.js, and React.js to simplify the deployment of working with data to the web. Plotly has inherently been about data visualization; a web app interface is the next logical step. This month, Alex Pawlowski, a graduate student at the University of Tennessee + Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will go over some of the techniques of Dash and the features that Plotly is continuing to add, with a focus on examples of how he uses Dash. He'll also cover how you can package Dash into a Docker container to deploy as an external app into a galaxy far, far away.

This month we'll have a workshop lead by Christopher Ostrouchov to help beginners learn AND practice the basic skills necessary to contribute to open source projects. If you are already familiar with the steps for a pull request we encourage you to attend so that we have more people to help others.

A computer of any operating system is required.

This workshop will follow the guide used at [PyCon 2018][1].

Steps that we will cover:

- setting up virtual environments
- using version control software
- interacting with version control repositories (repos)
- process of submitting patches and contributions

Python 3.7 is officially released! So this month we'll talk about some of the new features in the latest version of Python. We do not have a set agenda but volunteers are welcome to give a short demo or presentation about: breakpoint(), data classes, timing precision, type enhancements, ordered dictionaries, updates to asyncio, or some other new feature.

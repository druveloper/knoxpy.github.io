This month's meeting is all about the beginner. If you have never used Python or are just getting started, then this meet up is for you. We will help you install Python on your computer so bring your Linux, Mac, or Windows laptop. This workshop will also give an overview of the Python ecosystem to help guide you on your Python journey.

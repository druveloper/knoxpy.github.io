OAuth2 is a flexible protocol for authorization, and Single Sign-On via its partner, OpenID Connect, in decoupled application environments. That is to say, nearly everywhere. It is lightweight, provides granular and constant access-control, and works well with HTTP/Rest services. In this talk, we'll discuss the protocol itself and look at an implementation of a client, resource server, and authorizer using Python, the Tornado asynchronous web server, and AWS/Lambda/Chalice.

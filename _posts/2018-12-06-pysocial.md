This month we'll have a networking event at the Crafty Bastard Brewery. The event is not specific to developers - friends, significant others, and dogs are welcome too. You just need to be 21 to drink. A food truck will also be available so plan on grabbing some yum yums for dinner. This is the last meetup of 2018, we'll resume our regular Python discussions at the Technology Cooperative in February 2019.

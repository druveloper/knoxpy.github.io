Jupyter notebooks are documents that contain rich text elements, computer code snippets, and results from the code snippets. The results can be text, a set of plots, or even interactive widgets. Consequently, Jupyter notebooks have had a profound impact on data science, scientific data analysis, education, and several other areas. In this talk by Suhas Somnath, we will see the many capabilities of these notebooks and best practices on using them. We will also see how these notebooks have been instrumental in moving the scientific community towards open and reproducible research by serving as a code and data narrative that supplement journal articles.

Since being released, Python has become famous for its flexibility and its
readability. However, I'm willing to bet some of you don't realize just how
flexible Python can be. In this talk, Jacob McLemore will cover the basics of extending Python using custom code written in C that takes advantage of the Python API. Don't worry. No prior C knowledge is required! The talk will include a "crash course" in C at the beginning. By the end of the talk, you'll think that Python extensions are either really cool, really useful, or some mixture of the two.

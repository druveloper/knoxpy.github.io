Celebrate the end of 2019 and the demise of Python 2.7 during our annual PySocial event. Join us at the Pour Taproom for lively discussions and a chance to meet other Python enthusiasts in the Knoxville area. This event is in collaboration with the [KnoxData](https://knoxdata.org) group. **Note** - this is the last KnoxPy event that will be posted on Meetup. Follow us on our website, newsletter, and Twitter for upcoming events.

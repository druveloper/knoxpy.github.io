For most of us in the US South, Waffle House is a treasured staple that's open when we uhh... most need it. It's so open that, as you may have heard, FEMA uses an index - [the Waffle House index](https://www.fema.gov/blog/2011-07-07/news-day-what-do-waffle-houses-have-do-risk-management) - to determine how severe a disaster is, and how to appropriately mobilize resources. From hurricanes to tornado outbreaks, the closure of a Waffle House almost certainly means something catastrophic has happened. COVID-19 definitely fits that definition, and in response, Waffle House has closed nearly 20% of their locations, with curbside pickup and to-go orders at the other locations. Turns out, to keep track of all 1967 locations, Waffle House has a nifty api that feeds their online map to find the nearest Waffle House location to you. Since it's actually a well formatted, `geojson` feed, we can play around with `geopandas` and `requests` to build a map of closed locations and could be combined with other information to build deeper insights. We'll walk you through a jupyter notebook with a few mapping options including geopandas' built-in matplotlib plotting as well as plotly. We'll also talk about deploying a visualization to the web with a respectful request.

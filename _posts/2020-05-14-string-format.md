This month [Gavin Wiggins](https://gavinw.me) will talk about formatting strings in Python. Examples of alignment options, text width, grouping options, number precision, and more will be demonstrated. This will be a casual presentation so don't expect any slides, just some live coding in the iPython console. Join the meeting via Jitsi at <https://meet.jit.si/KnoxPyMay14> with the password kpy89$f54. If you don't want to use a browser, the desktop Jitsi Meet app is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-electron/releases).

      Welcome Pythonistas! The KnoxPy group meets on the first Thursday of
      every month from 6:30-8:30pm at the <a href="http://techco.org"
        target="_blank">Technology Cooperative</a> in downtown Knoxville.
      Meetings are informal and open to anyone interested in the Python
      programming language. We encourage lively discussion, demonstrations,
      and presentations by programmers of all skill levels.
      </p>
      <p>
      Topics discussed at our monthly meetings are listed below. Other
      resources for the group are located on our GitHub <a href="https://github.com/knoxpy" target="_blank">page</a>.

      <b>April - DOE Code</b>
      <br>
      This month Jay Jay Billings, <a href="https://twitter.com/jayjaybillings">@jayjaybillings</a>, will discuss his work in
      the Scientific Software Development Team at ORNL. His projects include
      battery simulation and additive manufacturing research. Jay is also
      involved with the DOE Code project to provide an open source platform for
      scientific software. More information about DOE Code is available at <a href="https://doecode.github.io">doecode.github.io</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>March - Python discussion</b>
      <br>
      We have nothing planned for this month's meeting. So any suggestions
      would be helpful otherwise we'll just have an open discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>February - KnoxDevs event</b>
      <br>
      Instead of our usual meeting this month, we encourage everyone to attend
      the KnoxDevs quarterly meeting. See the KnoxDevs site for more details.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>January - Python discussions</b>
      <br>
      Since there is no presentation scheduled this month, this is a good
      opportunity for everyone to learn something from other members in the
      group. If you have a particular question, consider posting it before the
      meeting in the comments section of this month's Meetup or in the #python
      channel on KnoxDevs Slack.

              <b>December - Building a blog with Django</b>
              <br>
              Django is a popular Python web framework that includes most of
              the functionality needed to create web applications. This month,
              Ricardo will give an overview of the Django architecture and how
              to create a very simple blog. He will also demonstrate the admin
              interface and use Django class based views to list and view blog
              entries. For more information about Django, visit the project's
              website at <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">djangoproject.com</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
              <b>October - Building a Website with Python and Flask</b>
              <br>
              With all the options for building websites these days, whether
              for your own project or for a professional client, choosing the
              right framework can be overwhelming. Fortunately, Python offers
              Flask which is a minimal (yet expressive) framework that is easy
              to extend. This month, Jared Smith will discuss why you should
              use Flask for your next project, explore some of the community
              around it, and finish with a demonstration of building a simple
              Reddit-like website for posting links and messages to a central
              feed.
              </p>

              <b>September - Introduction to Celery</b>
              <br>
              In this meeting,  Christopher Ostrouchov will introduce Celery in
              an interactive way, so make sure to bring your laptops (no
              installation will be needed).  Important concepts such as
              configuration, setting up remote workers, and managing task
              dependencies with Celery Canvas will be covered.  Chris has found
              Celery an extremely helpful tool for automating both long and
              short running tasks in HPC.  We hope to excite you with the
              simplicity of setting up Celery and getting started with
              automating complex jobs!

              <b>August - SciPy 2016 coverage</b>
              <br>
              This month we’ll have Jean Bilheux give an overview of what he
              learned at the SciPy 2016 conference. More info about the
              conference can be found at <a
                href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org/">scipy.org</a>. We will also
              give away a copy of "Python 101” by Michael Driscoll during the
              meeting; you must attend the meeting for a chance to win the
              book. We'll also have a "mystery" speaker make an announcement at the end of the meeting.

              <b>July - Attend CodeStock 2016</b>
              <br>
              To support the local tech community, we encourage everyone to
              attend the CodeStock conference in downtown Knoxville this month
              on July 15 and 16. You can purchase your tickets <a href="

              <b>June - Python Discussions</b>
              <br>
              Instead of having a presentation this month, we'll focus on 
              answering questions about Python. This is a good opportunity for 
              everyone to learn something from other members in the group. If 
              you don't have Python on your computer, feel free to bring your 
              Mac, Linux, or Windows laptop so we can help you install it on 
              your system. Also, if you have a particular question, consider 
              posting it before the meeting in the comments section of this 
              month's Meetup or in the #python channel on KnoxDevs Slack. See ya 
              in June!

                    without the need to provision or manage servers. The code
                    can be triggered from other AWS services or called directly
                    from any web or mobile app.

                    For our April meeting, we'll have a presentation about
                    using NumPy for scientific computing in Python by Gavin

                    Adam Haney, Bellhops CTO and Knoxville native will present
                    general architecture of the system. Bellhops is a web and
                    mobile platform that connects customers in 130 cities with
                    contractors who help with moving, labor and delivery tasks.
                    They have differentiated from the existing moving industry
                    by providing amazing customer service and technology that
                    allows them to provide moving help at a lower cost and with
                    much more convenience. They do all of this through mobile
                    and web applications supported by their RESTful API which
                    is written in Python using the Django web framework.
